# Mutually Exclusive Open Tab Groups
## or One Group Open At A Time

This simple extension allows only one tab group to be open per window. When one group is expanded, all other groups in that window automatically collapse. In addition, when a group is re-expanded, the tab most recently active in that group is re-focused as well.

My personal use-case for this extension is to maintain multiple distinct contexts/workspaces on a single laptop monitor.
